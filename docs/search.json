    "text": "1 Introduction\nFor visitors and people who are new to New York City, safety often comes to mind. We’d like to identify any trends to see which areas/boroughs are actually dangerous. We are especially curious about this since we are also new to the city.\nA few questions that come to mind are:\n\nWhat areas/boroughs are dangerous (tend to have more crime than other areas)?\nWhat areas are safe (tend to have less crime than other areas)?\nWhat types of crimes occurred?\nAre there seasonal patterns or trends over time when crimes occurred?\nAre there patterns in the premises these crimes occurred in?\nWhat groups are frequently targeted?"

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for all complete quarters so far this year (2023). This data is manually extracted and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning.\nEach record represents a criminal complaint in NYC and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to victim and suspect demographics is also included.\nThe data is provided by NYPD and is updated quarterly. It was made public in November 2018.\nWe can download the data from the NYPD and import into R as a csv file. Go to “export”, then download as CSV. It can be downloaded from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/data\nThere are 415310 rows and 36 columns. Important columns include:\nLocation:\n\nPrecinct where incident occurred\nBorough where incident occurred\nPatrol borough in which incident occurred\nPremise (grocery store, residence, street, etc)\nLocation at premise (inside premises, front of, rear of, etc)\nTransit station name\nParks: NYC park, greenspace, playground, if applicable\nNYCHA housing development level\nLatitude/Longitude\n\nCrime details:\n\nDate of incident\nTime of incident\nLevel of offense (felony, misdemeanor, violation)\nCrime success (indicates if crime was successful or failed)\nJurisdiction responsible for incident (ex: police, transit police, long island rail road, etc)\n\nIndividuals’ info:\n\nSuspect’s Age group\nSuspect’s race\nSuspect’s sex\nVictim’s age group\nVictim’s race\nVictim’s sex\n\nThere are also end date and end time columns, which are populated if initial date and time are not known. We will have to handle the rows where the exact timing of the crime is unknown.\nWe have details on the location, date, time, type of crime, premise, jurisdiction responsible, and crime success. We can look at the frequency of different crime levels across locations, premises, dates, and times. The location information (including latitude, longitude, and precinct) would allow us to plot a heatmap on top of the NYC map (which we can access from publicly available datasets in the form of shapely files) and visualize which neighborhoods are most prone to crime and which types of crimes are more prone in certain areas. The temporal information (including the date and times) could allow us to plot a timeseries graph to uncover insights on seasonal changes on different types of crime. This will shed insight on what parts of the year or day of the week are prone to certain types of crimes. Not only that, we can also compare different crime levels across victim age, race, and sex to observe if there is a correlation between age, race and sex to chance of being victimized by crime. We can also plot the frequency of successful crimes to failed ones across jurisdictions to analyze how often crimes are successful, and which jurisdiction fails or succeeds to stop them. This would also allow us to see what type of crimes are least likely to be committed successfully and at which times of the year and what locations within NYC."

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nHere we will plot only the columns that have null values. The other columns don’t have any null values:\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- read.csv('NYPD_Complaint_Data_Current__Year_To_Date_.csv')\ndf[df == \"(null)\"] &lt;- NA\n#df\n\n\n\n\nCode\nis_na &lt;- is.na(df)\nmissing_counts_sum &lt;- colSums(is_na)\nmissing_counts_percent &lt;- colMeans(is_na)\n\nplot_data_sum &lt;- data.frame(\n  column = names(missing_counts_sum),\n  missing_count = missing_counts_sum\n)\n\nplot_data_sum$column &lt;- factor(plot_data_sum$column, levels = plot_data_sum$column[order(plot_data_sum$missing_count)])\n\n\n\nplot_data_percent &lt;- data.frame(\n  column = names(missing_counts_percent),\n  missing_count = missing_counts_percent\n)\n\nplot_data_percent$column &lt;- factor(plot_data_percent$column, levels = plot_data_percent$column[order(plot_data_percent$missing_count)])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#print(nrow(df))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(plot_data_sum[plot_data_sum$missing_count &gt; 0, ], aes(x = column, y = missing_count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Number of missing values\", x = \"Column Names\", y = \"Counts\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(plot_data_percent[plot_data_percent$missing_count &gt; 0, ], aes(x = column, y = missing_count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percent of missing values\", x = \"Column Names\", y = \"Percentage\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some columns with almost all values missing: Hadevelopt, Parks_nm, Transit_district, Station_name, Housing_psa\nHadevelopt is the name of the housing development occurrence, and housing_psa is the development level code. This just means that almost all the crimes don’t happen around housing development. This makes sense since housing development in NYC is very scarce (one of the reasons housing is very expensive in the city).\nParks_nm indicates if the crime happened in a park or playground, so null values indicate most crimes did not happen in these areas. The same reasoning can be applied for null values for Station_name (indicating a subway station) and transit_district (district code for subway station).\nFor these columns, missing values just indicates the crime did not occur at that particular location. Since almost all the values are missing, we can drop these columns. We have another column that describes the location of the crime, so we aren’t losing any valuable information by dropping these.\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_rows &lt;- df[is.na(df$LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC), ]\ncategory_counts &lt;- table(filtered_rows$PREM_TYP_DESC)\n\nbarplot(category_counts[category_counts&gt;6000], main='Null premise location occurrences',\n        xlab = 'category',\n        ylab= 'count')\n\n\n\n\n\nLoc_of_occur_desc indicates if a crime occurred inside, in front of, or behind a premise. We noticed the null values happen when the premise is either the street or an NYC subway, so the exact location around the premises doesn’t make sense. We can probably drop this column since the information is not that useful.\nLet’s use another plot to examine the smaller missing values.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(plot_data_sum[plot_data_sum$missing_count &gt; 0 & plot_data_sum$missing_count &lt; 60000, ], aes(x = column, y = missing_count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Number of missing values (below 60000)\", x = \"Column Names\", y = \"Counts\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe count of missing values for suspect sex, race, and age group are the same. This indicates that the suspect got away with the crime. We should examine this data later to see if there is a trend for suspects who escaped, so let’s keep these missing values.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(plot_data_sum[plot_data_sum$missing_count &gt; 0 & plot_data_sum$missing_count &lt; 700, ], aes(x = column, y = missing_count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Number of missing values (below 700)\", x = \"Column Names\", y = \"Counts\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of these missing values are very minimal compared to amount of data we have. We can just drop these rows since missing values make up only about 1% for these features."

An offense punishable by up to a $250 fine or up to 15 days in jail. Examples of common violations include disorderly conduct and trespassing.\nMisdemeanors make up the highest proportion of crimes.

But since the difference isn’t huge, we also ran a chi-squared test to check independence:\n\n\nCode\nmonth_contingency_table &lt;- table(df$Month)\nmonth_contingency_table &lt;- month_contingency_table[month_contingency_table&gt;0]\n# print(month_contingency_table)\nmonth_chi_sq &lt;- chisq.test(month_contingency_table)\nprint(month_chi_sq)\n\n\n\n    Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  month_contingency_table\nX-squared = 1538.1, df = 8, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nAs you can see, the month does indeed affect the frequency of crime.\n\n\nCode\n# Crimes over time:\n\nvalue_counts &lt;- table(df[, c(\"OFNS_DESC\", \"Hour\")])\ncrime_df &lt;- data.frame(value_counts)\n\n# Severity\nggplot(df, aes(x = factor(Hour), color = LAW_CAT_CD, group = LAW_CAT_CD)) +\n  geom_point(stat = \"count\", size = 3) +\n  geom_line(stat = \"count\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Crimes over time (Severity)\",\n       x = \"Time (Hour)\", y = \"Count\", colour=\"Severity\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c( \"#3B0000\", \"#AF0000\", \"#FF0000\")) +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 5), labels = function(x) sprintf(\"%02d:00\", as.numeric(x))) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all severity levels, crimes tend to peak in the afternoon around 3-5pm. There is also a spike in crime at noon. This could be due to the fact that there are more people out and more shops open in the afternoon, which gives criminals more opportunity. Overall crime tends to decline at night.\nCrime is lowest at 5am, before it increases again into the morning. Let’s break down the types of crime even further for more information:\n\n\nCode\n# Top 5\ntop_categories &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(OFNS_DESC) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Count))\n  \ntop_5 &lt;- top_categories %&gt;% head(5)\ndata_filtered &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(OFNS_DESC %in% top_5$OFNS_DESC)\n\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = factor(Hour), color = OFNS_DESC, group = OFNS_DESC)) +\n  geom_point(stat = \"count\", size = 2, alpha=0.5) +\n  geom_line(stat = \"count\", size = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Crimes over time (Top 5 most common offenses)\",\n       x = \"Time (Hour)\", y = \"Count\", colour=\"Offense\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 5), labels = function(x) sprintf(\"%02d:00\", as.numeric(x))) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest crimes (Petit Larceny, Harrassment 2, and Grand Larceny) rise from 6am, peak at noon, and have a steep decline after 3pm. Assault 3 typically occurs in the afternoon, with peaks at noon and 3pm. This stays relatively high at night compared to the other top crimes.\n\n\nCode\n# Top 6-10\nsubset_crimes &lt;- top_categories %&gt;% slice(6:10)\ndata_filtered &lt;- crime_df %&gt;%\n  filter(OFNS_DESC %in% subset_crimes$OFNS_DESC)\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = factor(Hour), y=Freq, color = OFNS_DESC, group = OFNS_DESC)) +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\", size = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Crimes over time (Top 6-10)\",\n       x = \"Time (Hour)\", y = \"Count\", colour=\"Offense\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 5), labels = function(x) sprintf(\"%02d:00\", as.numeric(x))) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Top 11-15\nsubset_crimes &lt;- top_categories %&gt;% slice(11:15)\ndata_filtered &lt;- crime_df %&gt;%\n  filter(OFNS_DESC %in% subset_crimes$OFNS_DESC)\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = factor(Hour), y=Freq, color = OFNS_DESC, group = OFNS_DESC)) +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\", size = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Crimes over time (Top 11-15)\",\n       x = \"Time (Hour)\", y = \"Count\", colour=\"Offense\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 5), labels = function(x) sprintf(\"%02d:00\", as.numeric(x))) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsusp_df &lt;- df[df$SUSP_SEX != 'U',]\nsusp_df &lt;- susp_df[susp_df$SUSP_AGE_GROUP %in% c('&lt;18','18-24','25-44','45-64', '65+'),]\ncolnames(susp_df)[colnames(susp_df) == \"SUSP_AGE_GROUP\"] &lt;- \"Suspect_Age_Group\"\ncolnames(susp_df)[colnames(susp_df) == \"SUSP_SEX\"] &lt;- \"Suspect_Sex\"\ncolnames(susp_df)[colnames(susp_df) == \"SUSP_RACE\"] &lt;- \"Suspect_Race\"\n\nsusp_df %&gt;%\n  vcd::mosaic(fct_rev(LAW_CAT_CD) ~ Suspect_Age_Group + Suspect_Sex, \n              data = .,\n              direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n              main = 'Suspect Age Group and Sex',\n              labeling = labeling_border(\n                      xlab = \"lab\",\n                       gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 8),\n                       rot_labels = c(0,0,0,0),\n                       offset_label =c(0,0,0,-0.75),\n                       varnames = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),\n                       just_labels=c(\"center\",\"right\")\n                       ))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsusp_df %&gt;%\n  vcd::mosaic(fct_rev(LAW_CAT_CD) ~ Suspect_Race + Suspect_Sex, \n              data = .,\n              direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n              main = 'Suspect Race and Sex',\n              labeling = labeling_border(\n                      xlab = \"lab\",\n                       gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 6.5),\n                       rot_labels = c(30,0,0,0),\n                       offset_label =c(1.2,0,0,-0.75),\n                       varnames = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE),\n                       just_labels=c(\"center\",\"right\")\n                       ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nvic_df &lt;- df[!df$VIC_SEX %in% c('U', 'D', 'E', 'L'),]\nvic_df &lt;- vic_df[vic_df$VIC_AGE_GROUP %in% c('&lt;18','18-24','25-44','45-64', '65+'),]\ncolnames(vic_df)[colnames(vic_df) == \"VIC_AGE_GROUP\"] &lt;- \"Victim_Age_Group\"\ncolnames(vic_df)[colnames(vic_df) == \"VIC_SEX\"] &lt;- \"Victim_Sex\"\ncolnames(vic_df)[colnames(vic_df) == \"VIC_RACE\"] &lt;- \"Victim_Race\"\n\n\nvic_df %&gt;%\n  vcd::mosaic(fct_rev(LAW_CAT_CD) ~ Victim_Age_Group + Victim_Sex, \n              data = .,\n              direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n              main = 'Victim Age Group and Sex',\n              labeling = labeling_border(\n                      xlab = \"lab\",\n                       gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 8),\n                       rot_labels = c(0,0,0,0),\n                       offset_label =c(0,0,0,-0.75),\n                       varnames = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),\n                       just_labels=c(\"center\",\"right\")\n                       ))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nvic_df %&gt;%\n  vcd::mosaic(fct_rev(LAW_CAT_CD) ~ Victim_Race + Victim_Sex, \n              data = .,\n              direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n              main = 'Victim Race and Sex',\n              labeling = labeling_border(\n                      xlab = \"lab\",\n                       gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 6.5),\n                       rot_labels = c(30,0,0,0),\n                       offset_label =c(1.5,0,0,-0.75),\n                       varnames = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE),\n                       just_labels=c(\"center\",\"right\")\n                       ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnyc_map &lt;- map(database=\"nyc\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_geo &lt;- df[!is.na(df$Latitude),]\ndf_geo &lt;- df_geo[df_geo$Latitude &gt;

The binsize has been set to roughly cover 5 streets and 1 avenue. From here we can immediately see that most crimes are focused in Midtown Manhattan area just below Central Park. Not only that, Downtown Brooklyn, Downtown Flushing and the Bronx also show high crime activity. These are areas of high population density and it makes sense to have higher criminal activity in densely populated areas. As opposed to this, Staten Island has low crime rates, attributable to low population density.\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data=nyc_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"grey\", color = \"black\") + \n  geom_bin2d(data=df_geo, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), \n            binwidth = c(0.004, 0.004), alpha=0.9) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = inferno(100), \n                       name = \"Count/Pixel\",limits = c(-10, 100)) +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"Hour: {frame}\")\n  \n# Here comes the gganimate specific bits\nanimated_plot &lt;- p + transition_manual(Hour) +\n  enter_fade() +\n  exit_fade()\n\nanimate(animated_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis animation plot shows the evolution of crime rates throughout the day from 00 hour to 24 hour. As we can see, with agreement to the timeseries plot above, crime rates are highest during Noon~14 hour time, with hotspots apprearing in Midtown Manhattan, Harlem, Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn and Downton Flushing.\n\n\nCode\nfilter &lt;- df_geo$OFNS_DESC == 'PETIT LARCENY'\np &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data=nyc_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"grey\", color = \"black\") + \n  geom_bin2d(data=df_geo[filter, ], aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), \n            binwidth = c(0.004, 0.004), alpha=0.9) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = inferno(100), \n                       name = \"Petit Larceny/Pixel\",limits = c(-5, 40)) +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"Hour: {frame}\")\n  \n# Here comes the gganimate specific bits\nanimated_plot &lt;- p + transition_manual(Hour) +\n  enter_fade() +\n  exit_fade()\n\nanimate(animated_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis animation plot has been filtered by type of offense. In this case, this plot only shows petit larceny, the most common offense in NYC. Here we can see a similar pattern as previous animation plots, where hotspots appear in Midtown Manhattan. However, now we can see more granular hotspots of petit larceny. Note the hotspot in the western boundary between Bronx and Manhattan, in Central Bronx, in Queens. These hotspots correspond to where Target stores are at. In fact, Target has announced to pull out from various locations in NYC due to shoplifting causing major losses. Also note the hour at which these hotspots get saturated, it is around 15 hour, which is the hour with the most customers in Target. It seems the more people involved, the more likely petit larceny occurs. Lower Manhattan also shows huge amounts of petit larceny during this same hour.\n\n\nCode\nfilter &lt;- df_geo$OFNS_DESC == 'HARRASSMENT 2'\np &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data=nyc_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"grey\", color = \"black\") + \n  geom_bin2d(data=df_geo[filter, ], aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), \n            binwidth = c(0.004, 0.004), alpha=0.9) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = inferno(100), \n                       name = \"Harrassment/Pixel\",limits = c(-1, 10)) +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"Hour: {frame}\")\n  \n# Here comes the gganimate specific bits\nanimated_plot &lt;- p + transition_manual(Hour) +\n  enter_fade() +\n  exit_fade()\n\nanimate(animated_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows Harrasment instances, the second most common offense in NYC. We see this offense having hotspots in the Bronx, Brookyn and Harlem and not so much in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan. It also shows a consistent peak from 10 hour to 20 hour, which are times when people are generally active. Unlike petit larceny, the hotspots are not as focused but more spread out.\n\n\nCode\nfilter &lt;- df_geo$OFNS_DESC == 'ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES'\np &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data=nyc_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"grey\", color = \"black\") + \n  geom_bin2d(data=df_geo[filter, ], aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), \n            binwidth = c(0.004, 0.004), alpha=0.9) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = inferno(100), \n                       name = \"Misdemeanor Assault/Pixel\",limits = c(-1, 10)) +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"Hour: {frame}\")\n  \n# Here comes the gganimate specific bits\nanimated_plot &lt;- p + transition_manual(Hour) +\n  enter_fade() +\n  exit_fade()\n\nanimate(animated_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows Misdemeanor Assaults, the 3rd most common type. This crime shows similar patterns to harrasment. This makes sense considering the similarity of Assault and Harrasment.\n\n\nCode\nfilter &lt;- df_geo$OFNS_DESC == 'GRAND LARCENY'\np &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data=nyc_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"grey\", color = \"black\") + \n  geom_bin2d(data=df_geo[filter, ], aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), \n            binwidth = c(0.004, 0.004), alpha=0.9) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = inferno(100), \n                       name = \"Grand Larceny/Pixel\",limits = c(-1, 10)) +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"Hour: {frame}\")\n  \n# Here comes the gganimate specific bits\nanimated_plot &lt;- p + transition_manual(Hour) +\n  enter_fade() +\n  exit_fade()\n\nanimate(animated_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows Grand Larceny, the 4th most common type. Here we can see that Midtwon and Downtown Manhattan are hotspots for this type of crime. Considering the affluence of those regions this makes sense. It also seems to be more active during 10 hour to 20 hour, when people are generally active.\n\n\nCode\nfilter &lt;- df_geo$OFNS_DESC == 'FELONY ASSAULT'\np &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data=nyc_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"grey\", color = \"black\") + \n  geom_bin2d(data=df_geo[filter, ], aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), \n            binwidth = c(0.004, 0.004), alpha=0.9) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = inferno(100), \n                       name = \"Felony Assault/Pixel\",limits = c(-1, 10)) +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"Hour: {frame}\")\n  \n# Here comes the gganimate specific bits\nanimated_plot &lt;- p + transition_manual(Hour) +\n  enter_fade() +\n  exit_fade()\n\nanimate(animated_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows Assault Felonies, the 5th most common type. Here we can see a similar pattern to Harrassment, where hotspots are located in The Bronx, Harlem, Downtown Brooklyn areas."
